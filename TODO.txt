TODO:

Make functions to analyze the accuracy in the simulator (how energy is conserved, aso...)

Make all methods less coupled with AWT.

Make a SWING demo (low priority)

Write documentation on the methods(!)

Make a few more and somewhat more exotic RigidBodies. Red from a file (done), and letters (low priority)

Redesign the RigidBody-class by moving some methods to another (super-)class; RigidPolygon.

Grep after "TODO" in all .java-files and correct stuff.


DONE:

Make a comined add/mul -method in State too save some memory (low priority)
Move the integrators outside RigidBody.
Make a screentransform so that one pixel dont correspond to one meter(!!)
Put in the angular momentum equations
Collision detection
Bounding sphere check
Make a nice AWT demo.
Implement a feature so that bodies can be "dragged" around (considered cool)
Draw filled polygons instead of wireframe
Make the simulation run in realtime using the system clock (low priority)
